# Seattle Crime Police Dataset

Description
This data represents crime reported to the Seattle Police Department (SPD). Each row contains the record of a unique event where at least one criminal offense was reported by a member of the community or detected by an officer in the field. The Dataset is used in meetings for strategic planning, accountability and performance managment. This updated process includes all records of crime reports logged in the Departments Records Management System (RMS) since 2008, which are tracked as part of the SeaStat process. Records are evolved daily and are continually refreshed.
